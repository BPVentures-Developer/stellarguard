            Ceasing Operations
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            StellarGuard LLC reserves the right to cease operations at any time.
            However, StellarGuard LLC will provide account holders 90 days of
            notice of its intent to shut down. This will give users time to
            deactivate the StellarGuard multisignature on their accounts. At
            least 5 days prior to ceasing operations, StellarGuard will email
            the registered email of StellarGuard users that have Stellar
            accounts that are still linked to StellarGuard the private key that
            is used to sign transactions for their account.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Failure to deactivate your account before StellarGuard ceases
            operations may lead to a loss of your ability to create
            transactions. Users are encouraged to add a backup signer to their
            accounts to be able to continue to sign transactions even without
            StellarGuard.
