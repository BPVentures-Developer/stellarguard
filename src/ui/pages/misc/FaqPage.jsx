            <Typography paragraph>
              StellarGuard uses the Stellar&apos;s built in multi-signature
              technology to require a transaction to be signed both by you and
              by StellarGuard before it is considered valid.
            </Typography>

            <Typography paragraph>
              To activate StellarGuard, you first need to add your StellarGuard
              signer public key as an additional signer on your account. You
              also have the option to add a backup signer. The application makes
              it easy to build this transaction so you can submit it to Stellar.
              After adding StellarGuard as an additional signer you must click
              activate to finalize the link to your StellarGuard account. After
              this is done your account is protected by StellarGuard.
            </Typography>

            <Typography paragraph>
              After you have a verified your email address, when you submit a
              transaction to StellarGuard an email authorization code will be
              sent to you. This code will be required to authorize the
              transaction and submit it to the Stellar network.
            </Typography>

            <Typography paragraph>
              You may also choose to add enhanced security by enabling
              two-factor authentication via an authenticator application. When
              you add two-factor authentication to your account, a rotating
              passcode that is generated by a mobile app will required to sign
              in or authorize transactions.

              In the future, if a paid plan is introduced you will ALWAYS have

              account, even if you have not yet paid.

            <Typography paragraph>
              No! StellarGuard was designed with this scenario. Because your
              account is protected with multisig, a hacker will not be able to
              create valid transactions without the other half of the signature,
              which is protected by StellarGuard.

            <Typography paragraph>
              No! Because StellarGuard does not ask you for your own secret key,
              a hacker who is able to infiltrate StellarGuard still cannot
              create valid transactions.

            id="backup-signer"
          >
            <Typography paragraph>
              If you feel more comfortable not completely relying on
              StellarGuard, you have the option to add a &quot;Backup
              Signer&quot; when enabling multisig. A backup signer is an
              additional public key that you know the secret key to (does not
              have to be a funded account) which can be used instead of your
              primary secret key to sign transactions. StellarGuard does not
              save the backup signer key.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              If you do choose to add a backup signer, you should make sure you
              keep it in a safe place and do not use it for day-to-day
              transactions, and only use it in an emergency. If a hacker steals
              the backup signer, they will be able to steal your XLM. You may
              add a backup signer at any time by submitting it as a normal
              transaction.

            <Typography paragraph>
              The transaction XDR created when setting up multisig with
              StellarGuard is composed of the following parts:

            <Typography paragraph>
              Unfortunately Stellar does not have a notion of
              &quot;half-signed&quot; multi-signature transactions that can be
              submitted to the Stellar network -- those are just rejected with
              an authorization error and not stored anywhere. This means that in
              order to use StellarGuard you must submit your half-signed
              transaction to StellarGuard so it can sign it with its key and
              submit the fully-signed, valid transaction to the Stellar network.
